# Matt-s-Introductory-Machine-Learning-Course
This is a long and thorough review of machine learning I learned in my Springboard bootcamp course including NLP and deep learning along with various applications in business situations.  I created the course first having set all the marks and standards for all unit tests, exams, assignments and quizzes sourced from credible websites that I believe provide valuble information.  I forget all the answers when deciding how exactly they should be marked before beginning the course.  I have provided a current summary report card of my grades and completed tasks.  Please note that my standards are very high and I don't believe in grade inflation like many universities have done over the years.  A 'C' grade is considered average and entails acceptable comprehension and capability of applying the material to many different machine learning projects. A 'B' grade is considered very good.  A 'D' grade is a pass and it means that the student knows the basic components of machine learning which I'm estimating most people can achieve given that they have completed the course.  An 'A' is very hard to get.

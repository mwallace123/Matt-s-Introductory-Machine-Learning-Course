# Matt-s-Introductory-Machine-Learning-Course
This is a long and thorough review of machine learning I learned in my Springboard bootcamp course including NLP and deep learning along with various applications in business situations.  I created the course first having set all the marks and standards for all unit tests, exams, assignments and quizzes sourced from credible websites that I believe provide valuble information.  I forget all the answers when deciding how exactly they should be marked before beginning the course.  I have provided a current summary report card of my grades and completed tasks.  Please note that my standards are very high and I don't believe in grade inflation like many universities have done over the years.  A C grade is considered average and entails acceptable comprehension and capability of applying the material to projects as it should be where as with most universities and colleges many students get B's and A's nowadays.  There are too many students that are getting A's in schools and now these things are expected by many people when the curriculums have been diluted and nobody's getting a real education.  In my courses, a B grade is considered very good.
